Note: If you are unable to view the code, and it says 'An error occurred while reloading '.ipynb' file, which is a GitHub backend issue. You can try this:                         
Step 1: Open-> https://nbviewer.org/                                                                                                              
Step 2: Copy the link of the '.ipynb' code file and paste it into 'nbviewer'. You will be able to see the code file.
